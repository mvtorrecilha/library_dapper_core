# Library API

This project aims to control the borrowing of books from a fictional library.

## Technologies implemented:

- ASP.NET 6.0
- Dapper
- MediatR
- Swagger

Features available for access:
- [List of Students](#list-of-students)
- [List of Books](#list-of-books)
- [Borrow a book](#borrow-a-book)

## Getting Started
To run this project you will need:

1. .Net core sdk 6.0 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

1. MSSql LocalDb - (https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/c/1/7c14e92e-bdcb-4f89-b7cf-93543e7112d1/SqlLocalDB.msi)

1. NodeJs (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

With all these tools installed, run the following commands in your operating system's terminal:

## Usage

```
dotnet run --project .\backend\src\Library.Api\Library.Api.csproj -- seed
```
This command will run the site on url "https://localhost:5001" and the database will already be created with some data already inserted. You can check the data in the **DatabaseBoostrp.cs** file.

**Note: Every time you execute this command the data in the tables will be deleted. To not erase the data, just remove the argument "-- seed"**

## Run the tests

```
dotnet test ./backend/src/Library.UnitTests/Library.UnitTests.csproj
```
## Docker Usage

```
docker-compose up
```
